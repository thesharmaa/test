It is a Java specification that gives some functionality and standard to ORM tools.
It is considered as a link between an object-oriented model and a relational database system. As it is a specification of Java, JPA does not conduct any functioning by itself. Therefore, it needs implementation. Hence, for data persistence ORM tools like Hibernate implements JPA specifications.
JPA is only a specification, it is not an implementation.
The major difference between Hibernate and JPA is that Hibernate is a framework while JPA is API specifications. Hibernate is the implementation of all the JPA guidelines
