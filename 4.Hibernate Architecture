Hibernate Architecture
Hibernate is an ORM framework with a layered architecture that helps the user to operate without having to know
the underlying APIs. It also makes use of the database and configuration data to provide persistence services to
the application.
There are basically 3 layers in this architecture:-
Application Layer
Hibernate Core Layer
Database Layer
