1.) What is Inheritance?
-> It is a property in which one object acquires all the properties & behaviours of parent object.
-> Inheritance is also known as IS-A relationship. 
-> The main advantage of Inheritance is code reusability and it is achieved by using 'extends; keyword.
-> Types : Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarichal, Hybrid Inheritance out which Multiple and Hybrid is not acceptable in Java.


2.) What is Abstraction?
-> Abstraction is a process used for hiding implementation by just exposing the services which is 
   being offered just because of security reasons.
-> Ex : ATM GUI
-> Advantage : Security, Without affecting end user we can change internal operation or implementation.


3.) What is Encapsulation? 
-> The process of grouping data members and corresponding methods into a single unit is Encapsulation.
-> Any Java class is an example of Encapsulation.
-> If any component follows data hiding(fields marked private) and abstraction(Methods with no body) that is said to be encapsulated component.


4.) What is Polymorphism?
-> Polymorphism in java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
-> Types : Method Overloading / Dynamic / Runtime: When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these 
           functions are said to be overloaded.
           
           Method Overriding / Static / Compile-Time: If not satisfied with parent method implementation then child is allowed to redefine it then 
           this process is known as Method Overriding.
